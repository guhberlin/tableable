### How to change this webpages

Be sure you never edit the 'index.html'. This file will be created automatically with the build.php.
If you want to edit the page you have to change raw.html or any file under html/.

#### Usage of build-script:

```bash
./build.php
```

The script builds the index.html and the css/guhberlin.min.css.
